### Have LLMs operate your computer 
#### Complete tedious everyday-tasks with one command 

Open Interface can
- Simulate keyboard and mouse input. 
- Take user requests through text or voice.
- Make calls to LLMs (GPT-4V) with your request and a screenshot of the current state of your computer.  
- Execute the steps received on your behalf to operate your computer, periodically sending back a screenshot of the updated state. 

### Installation
- Example of uploading binary on github https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide?tab=readme-ov-file#readme

### Many Things it's Bad at

- Accurate spatial-reasoning and hence clicking buttons.
- Keeping track of itself in tabular contexts like excel and google sheets for similar reasons as stated above.
- Navigating complex GUI-rich applications like iMovie, Garage Band, etc.


### Future 
(with better models and training on Youtube tutorials) 
- Take the pictures from my Tahoe trip and make a White Lotus type montage in iMovie.
- Find my friends' music taste from Spotify and create a party playlist for tonight's event.
- Create a couple of bass samples for me in Garage Band for my latest project.

### Notes
- Cost: $0.05 - $0.20 per request. <br>This should be much lower in the near future once GPT-4V enables assistant/stateful mode.
