### Make LLMs Operate Your Computer for You
#### Complete Tedious Everyday-tasks with One Command 

Open Interface can
- Simulate keyboard and mouse input. 
- Take user requests through text or voice.
- Make calls to LLMs (GPT-4V) with your request and a screenshot of the current state of your computer.  
- Execute the steps received on your behalf to operate your computer, periodically sending back a screenshot of the updated state.

### Installation
- Example of uploading binary on github https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide?tab=readme-ov-file#readme


### Demo
[Video](Video)


### Many Things it's Bad at

- Accurate spatial-reasoning and hence clicking buttons.
- Keeping track of itself in tabular contexts like excel and google sheets for similar reasons as stated above.
- Navigating complex GUI-rich applications like iMovie, Garage Band, etc.


### Future 
(with better models trained on video walkthroughs like Youtube tutorials) 
- Take the pictures from my Tahoe trip and make a White Lotus type montage in iMovie.
- Find my friends' music taste from Spotify and create a party playlist for tonight's event.
- Create a couple of bass samples for me in Garage Band for my latest project.

### Notes
- Cost: $0.05 - $0.20 per request. <br>(This will be much lower in the near future once GPT-4V enables assistant/stateful mode)
