    LLM Request
    {
    	"original_user_request": ...,
    	"step_num": ...,
    	"screenshot": ...
    }

    step_num is the count of times we've interacted with the LLM for this user request. If it's 0 we know it's a fresh user request,
    	if it's greater than 0 then we know we are already in the middle of a request.
    	Therefore, if the number is positive and from the screenshot it looks like request is complete, then return an empty list in steps and a string in done. Don't keep looping the same request.

    		},
    		{...},
    		...
    	],
    	"done": ...
    }

    function is the function name to call in the executor.
    parameters are the parameters of the above function.
    human_readable_justification is what we can use to debug in case program fails somewhere or to explain to user why we're doing what we're doing.
    done is None if user request is not complete, and it's a string when it's complete that either contains the information that the user asked for, or just acknowledges completion of the user requested task. This is going to be communicated to the user if it's present.
